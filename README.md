## Recommended Settings

ðŸ’» To get the most out of Neon City, we recommend the following settings:

- **Use a Nerd Font**: Nerd Fonts are a collection of fonts that add additional glyphs to your editor, such as icons for programming languages and tools. We recommend installing a Nerd Font and using it with Neon City for an enhanced coding experience. See [this guide](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for a list of Nerd Fonts.
- **Enable Ligatures**: Ligatures are a typographic feature that combine two or more characters into a single glyph. We recommend enabling ligatures for an enhanced coding experience.

ðŸ’¡ In addition to these settings, we recommend the following VS Code settings:

```
"workbench.colorTheme": "Neon City",
"editor.fontFamily": "'Hack Nerd Font', 'Fira Code Nerd Font', 'Jetbrains Mono Nerd Font', 'monospace'",
